      "1. Use the wine data set to show what *overfitting* is in terms of a regression problem. (see: white_data.npy, white_targets.npy, red_data.npy, red_targets.npy)\n",
      "2. Discuss how low and high *bias* and *variance* come into play here using figure(s), and write down what *model complexity* has to do with it.\n",
      "3. One way to deal with your overfitted data in a frequentist setting is regularized regression. Use your pick of regularized regression here and apply a cross-validation scheme to determine the regularization parameter $\\lambda$. \n",
      "4. Finally, shortly explain the Bayesian point-of-view on what you have done and how this would prevent overfitting. How could you use the Bayesian method to select the best model for your data? Contrast between model averaging and model selection and use the latter to select a good model.\n",

      "* This time we emphasize code cleanness and will allocate **[20 points]** to the readability of your code and graphical output.\n",
      "* Use your own implementations instead of standard Python machine-learning tools, like `sk-learn`. More standard modules like `numpy` are allowed as always.\n",
      "* As always: make sure you submit all included data and files necessary to run your notebook out-of-the-box!"
